Chickens were domesticated in Southern China around 8,000 years ago in 6000 B C The color of the egg depends on the chickens earlobes. Red ear lobed chickens lay brown eggs, while white ear lobed chickens lay white eggs uni100

[03:13:15.093] DerpvisLive: @edisonparklive 10 push up multiply the placing except first. how about that
[03:13:15.384] angelweqs: RANK 2-4 = 10 push up rank 5-6 = 15 push up and bottom 2 is 20 push up @edisonparklive
[03:13:20.761] Professor_Doubledoor: youll break even eventually

[03:13:43.870] xsicho: Cheer100 Please no pushups, allow your muscles to rest since you haven't done it in too long and atrophy kicks in, try others like crunches or squats instead so you can have a full body workout instead

[03:14:27.548] YaBoiley: 3 days is average rest time'

[03:14:44.797] billyabong: 3 days is enough for most people but you're 80 years old in the shade mate cheer100
[03:14:46.999] xsicho: 3 days is enough IF and ONLY IF you did it regularly, give it a week rest for this firs tweek

[03:16:15.142] DerpvisLive: Pog do more pushups
[03:16:19.490] YaBoiley: @edisonparklive conversely to losing and doing push-ups, you have a flat amount of push-ups like 100, and you decrease from that every time you get above 4th place KeK
[03:16:36.695] YaBoiley: @billyabong you play league right?
[03:16:41.881] Juroph: YaBoiley you want him to do 100 again LUL
[03:16:46.496] DerpvisLive: losing = getting healthier + fitter. it is great

[03:18:59.167] xboxcrusher33: 4/5
[03:19:02.677] YaBoiley: just a quality of life top for TFT, if you have a full bench and you can upgrade, but your bench is full and you need 2 units it auto does it
[03:19:10.105] ShadirHS: Cheer100 Do you feel like items are too RNG for how important they are? Someone with 6 units can easily win against someone with 8 regardless of level if they have better item RNG
[03:19:13.176] Juroph: Potterapple why doesn your badge change
[03:19:27.231] Juroph: does*
[03:19:30.490] Potterapple: MONKERS
[03:19:35.400] Potterapple: I needed to flex MONKERS
[03:19:52.161] YaBoiley: @edisonparklive pretty sure each time ww hits his ult it stacks as well
[03:20:02.770] Juroph: tjsRIP
[03:20:04.996] YaBoiley: rengar is wild rite?
[03:20:09.528] Potterapple: Wait wait Bailey?
[03:20:15.965] ShadirHS: I got 5 items from creeps previous game, 4 of them were tears
[03:20:19.297] ShadirHS: I was in tears myself too..
[03:20:20.053] Potterapple: Stacks how?
[03:20:28.192] SparkPJ: yeah the item thing seems like a mess, holding out that it is a beta and there is a lot of room for change
[03:20:29.726] groled2: @edisonparklive scarra mentioned that he wanted the rolls to be more like dota autochess where u never get the same champions from roll to roll, ur thoughts?
[03:20:30.988] YaBoiley: @Potterapple wild buff stacks attack speed up to 8 times
[03:20:35.850] heyhellos: !time
[03:20:36.198] BushNationBot: @heyhellos, you currently have spent 361 hours and 15 minutes in the chat.

[03:20:38.072] Akito_Soma: bonjour hello all
[03:20:38.289] YaBoiley: when ww ults, it stacks
[03:20:41.461] billyabong: @YaBoiley I have played but don't anymore
[03:20:41.897] Juroph: YaBoiley in tft ww ulti doesnt count as aa sadly
[03:20:49.836] YaBoiley: oh damn nvm
[03:20:57.535] YaBoiley: it'd be kind of op
[03:21:01.747] YaBoiley: if you had a rageblade
[03:21:02.862] MoneyGP: they need to balance out the item distribution. Someone else gets 3 items in a single wave while I have 0 the entire game.
[03:21:05.204] YaBoiley: like 8 free stacks
[03:21:06.451] Juroph: statik shiv and titanic dont work either
[03:21:07.540] YaBoiley: it makes sense
[03:21:10.726] YaBoiley: wow
[03:21:11.841] kakkoiianku: what about underlord style of letting you choose 1 item out of 3 per neutral wave
[03:21:13.383] Deja_Moo: RFC is fixed @edisonparklive
[03:21:15.997] Juroph: that would be cool
[03:21:18.275] 18dkang: bushHYPERS bushHYPERS bushHYPERS

[03:21:29.000] 18dkang: you got this edison LETSS GO #1
[03:21:32.303] YaBoiley: it makes sense tho, ww would be top tier if it did
[03:21:34.540] Deja_Moo: @Juroph ? Shiv works fine.
[03:21:36.550] YaBoiley: and he's already pretty damn good

[03:22:15.894] SparkPJ: i've been good man, what was the lecture about? will there be a test?
[03:22:16.457] Deja_Moo: @Juroph His ulti counts as 1 attack, not a series of of attacks
[03:22:18.450] 18dkang: truuuuuuuuuu

[03:23:09.858] UyuYeomso: @Ahmed580 HUGERS
[03:23:18.655] Deja_Moo: @Juroph It would be a balancing issue. Theres a lot of things in LoL that don't act like they do in TFT for several reasons.
[03:23:20.420] ExonER: @Ahmed580 careful, he might propose to you next time on stream ;D

[03:26:48.637] Deja_Moo: @bygana There isn't really a unit 'tier' list because some units are only good with certain synergies. it's moreover learning which synergies work with which units
[03:26:57.684] eunicek94: i just played a game and i got whooped
[03:27:15.975] bygana: @Deja_Moo got it! thank you.

[03:29:41.674] Iendyn: @SparkPJ honestly shyv is a good unit on her own but the dragon buff is pretty busted
[03:29:48.164] Juroph: i keep forgeting that there is like no delay LUL
[03:29:48.299] YaBoiley: @edisonparklive reposition your ww maybe, so it gets the zeke bonus
[03:30:03.066] shadowgx100: ohh a shiv
[03:30:11.241] Potterapple: @edisonparklive Do you know the item combinations well because you played so much or because you played league? PepoThink
[03:30:13.122] SparkPJ: @Iendyn the shyvana ult looks so bugged (not because it is because she usually ults in on League LUL)

[14:19:00.701] Potterapple: Juroph When does he not make Pepega decisions KeK
[14:19:22.568] Kermit4: @sugaming2 so each round new champs at the bottom show up with there respective prices. If you get three they level up to level 2. If you get 3 level 2 they go to level 3. If you get the same type of champs (the side bar) they give a boost of some sort. You also collect items throughout and can put on the champions.
